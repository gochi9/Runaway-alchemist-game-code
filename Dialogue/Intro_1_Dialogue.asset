  - You are a member of a proud family, a family with a long history in poetry, literature,
    and the arts. However, time has not been kind to you, your brother, or your parents,
    nor to your recent ancestors. Your talent has simply diminished over time.
  - Now, the only thing you have left is the legacy of your family, as you are unable
    to reciprocate and continue it. Currently, you own a bar inside one of the buildings
    owned by your ancestors. This is all that has remained, with a basement overrun
    with mushrooms, plants, mold, moss, and other growths. No matter how many you
    pick up, they always grow back.
  - "You are more of the studious type, not attracted to the arts. It\u2019s a pity,
    for the people in the current era have started to lose faith in the church and
    wars, and now a reformation is underway. Everyone is looking to literature, paintings,
    furniture, architecture, politics, and much more. Your ancestors would have been
    even more famous if they were still alive. Alas, it is you who lives in this
    current time."
  - One fateful night, when you drowned your sorrows in alcohol, alone because your
    brother was out late running some errands, you felt everything was starting to
    go downhill and the legacy of your family falling even lower than rock bottom.
    You decided to study and read again the short stories and poems of your family.
  - In your drunken stupor, you sprawled everything on the floor and opened them.
    It might have been your intoxicated conscience, but something began to look amiss.
    Individually, they seemed like normal, really good pieces of literature, each
    with a message written by the author.
  - However, looking at more of them at the same time, something began to emerge.
    Certain characters seemed to symbolize specific elements, and specific plot points
    resembled some sort of processes. Lines in poems formed acrostics that hinted
    at deeper meanings, and hidden letters revealed instructions when the book was
    hit directly by moonlight with the shadows of a candle nearby. The rich descriptions
    and metaphors in the literature pointed toward concealed messages.
  - 'With a pen in hand and a few good hours, you resolved to uncover the secret
    meaning behind the legacy left by your family. The uncovered messages read as
    follows:'
  - "\u201CTo our kin, the descendants of a noble lineage, we share the tale of our
    ancestors, masters of alchemy. Once, they created wonders by transmuting elements.
    But when the church deemed our practices pagan, we hid our knowledge in poetry
    and prose, preserving our wisdom through literature."
  - "\u201COur blood has a unique property: it messes with our, that\u2019s why we
    are colorblind, but at the same time it has certain magical properties, which
    is key to revealing hidden truths in our family texts under certain conditions.\u201C"
  - "\u201CThe cauldrons in our cellar holds alchemical secrets visible only to our
    bloodline.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThe basements of our homes are enchanted realms, teeming with life. The
    mushrooms, plants, mold, and moss that thrive therein are not mere nuisances
    but essential ingredients for our alchemical endeavors. In these sacred spaces,
    nature herself conspires to provide the fundamental elements we require.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIf the world becomes safe for our art again, revive our traditions. If
    not, preserve this knowledge for the future, when alchemy will be practiced once
    more. Our work endures, awaiting a more enlightened age.\u201D"
  - "Reading this, you\u2019ve found out the secret and the origins of your family. "
  - 'Alchemy! '
  - 'Famous alchemists, the majority of whom have been driven to extinction during
    a time when the church had a lot of power. '
  - "However, in today's age, the church is not as powerful as before, and people\u2019s
    attention has switched to something more important. The time is prime now! That
    means\u2026"
