  - That you might be the light of your family!
  - "The time is just right; there won\u2019t be attention drawn towards you, at
    least not for a while. You\u2019ll have to operate from the shadows, in your
    dark and gloomy basement filled with stagnant air and lit by candlelight."
  - "Trying to get more fancy ingredients is out of the question; you\u2019ll need
    to use what grows on your walls: the grass, the mold, the moss, the fungi\u2014anything
    that looks like it might have life. You\u2019ll need to deal with shady individuals
    and hone your skills."
  - "While you can use the bar as a fa\xE7ade, that won\u2019t hold for very long.
    Suspicion will arise, and you might have to hide your crafts during inspections.
    Your brother will be beside you, gathering some materials for you and picking
    up orders from individuals that might be trustworthy. Though your cellar door
    may welcome other guests."
  - "Your plan is to run away to the other side of the continent with your brother,
    where the church\u2019s reach is almost nonexistent\u2014a land where people
    like you might thrive, and your knowledge is guaranteed to bring you success,
    ensuring your family legacy survives."
  - "Don\u2019t get too excited; you\u2019ll have to stay low for now. Remember to
    move as discreetly as a shadow; don\u2019t gather attention. You\u2019ll need
    50,000 pena, your country\u2019s main currency, a coin made of a mixture of gold,
    copper, bronze, and silver. 25,000 for each."
  - Your adventure begins here and now. Quickly! Familiarize yourself better with
    the place you might spend the rest of your life in.
